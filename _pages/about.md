I am a philosopher specializing in 19th Century German Philosophy, Ancient Greek Philosophy, and Moral Psychology. I received my Ph.D. in Philosophy from DePaul University in 2025, where I defended my dissertation *The Abyss of Justice: Nietzsche's Psychology and the Problem of the Ideal Life* with Distinction.
